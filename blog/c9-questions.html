      <h1>How to Ask Questions</h1>

     <h2>Setting up a Question</h2>
      <p>Asking questions is a really huge part of my personality, and how I view myself. I tend to ask question. Constantly. I'm very curious about every little thing that happens and I immediately jump on it with a question, sometimes before I even consider the answer myself. I think this can be an issue for me, I find myself rapid-firing questions to my pair during a session and notice that it can be overwhelming and confusing. I thought about the characteristics that make a good question, and here's what I think:</p><br>

      <p>To ask a good question you must first:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Consider the answer to the question yourself first. Do you actually know the answer already?</li>
        <li>Ask yourself: Is this question requesting information, clarification, or affirmation?</li>
        <li>Consider the context of the other's person's mind. Are they in the same context as you?</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Let's break these three points down further.</p><br>
      <p>The first point--check to see if you already know the answer. This may lead to you rephrase your question so that it is asking for clarification, feedback or affirmation, instead of asking for information. I find myself on many occasions asking a question that I actually know the answer to, just so I can find out if the other person has the same answer too. I think this can be confusing and inefficient, and may lead my partner into thinking we're not on the same page. These types of questions could be prefaced with "I'm thinking this. Do you agree, and/or do you see it differently?"</p><br>

      <p>This leads to the second point. I need to consider more what I want the answer to be before I ask the question. Do I want the person or tool at the other end to just supply a statement, or am I look more for "how-to" process? Maybe I am just looking for guidance so I can find the answer myself. In all these cases, the phrasing of the question should change based on the type of answer I'm seeking.</p><br>

      <p>The third point is extremely important when asking a peer or instructor a question. I am always trying to improve myself on this point, because I've noticed that I ask a lot of questions out of context. Of course, it seems to be in context to me because it was part of my thinking pattern, but it's not always obvious to the other person where my train of thought came from. It's crucial that I SLOW DOWN and take a step back to first explain where I am coming from, what I'm thinking about, and what even led me to ask the question in the first place. Mostly, I just need to slow down!</p><br>

      <p>My constant questioning is both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, I'm never short of questions to ask, I can always find something to pick at. On the other hand, I need to learn to control my question-asking so that the people around me can follow my thought process and better guide me to finding the answers I'm seeking. This is a balancing act between thinking about the question, formulating it into a coherent sentence, and then communicating it to others in a language and style that is easily understandable and makes sense in context.</p><br> 

      <p>I've spent most of this post talking about asking friends or teacher's questions in person. The etiquette for asking questions online is similar, but I think there's a few more points to consider. For example, the question's wording and subject lines should be as proofread, explicit and detailed as possible. This will help someone understand your question without any prior knowledge or ability to ask you to clarify. If a question has grammatical errors, or doesn't reference every piece of the puzzle, it would be difficult for an outsider to give an accurate and well-informed response. For code specifically, it seems the best etiquette is to identify the block of code that is giving you problems and ask specific and explicit questions about that section, otherwise it would be very time consuming for an outsider to come in and figure out the problem with little context.</p><br>

      <p>I really liked the sites that DevBootcamp recommended to read for this blog post. There were suggestions about asking code-related questions that I hadn't considered before. Here are a few I think are the most important:</p><br>
      <ul>
      <li>Save all the sites you looked at to help you solve the problem, even if they were not useful. This will help someone else further your search without wasting time.</li>
      <li>Try to sum up your question in the title, this will help on forums. Also, good examples phrase the title like a question (i.e. Why does...in Ruby?)</li>

      <li>Remember to include the language you're searching for (i.e. Ruby).</li>

      <li>Check on your question in a forum to see if anyone asks for clarification.</li>
      </ul><br>

      <p>Last but not least, I've found that being polite and humble will always take you far in the world of question-asking. Sometimes I get more information than I asked for, but I usually enjoy that, listen and continue learning.</p>
