    <h2>
      Dear everyone--or so they say--HELLO WORLD!
    </h2>
      <p>
      I've just about completed my first week of DevBootcamp Phase 0 and I must say, I'm impressed the amount of material covered in such short time. It's now drilled into my core that understanding how to use commands in the terminal is like the trunk of my DBC education tree, off of which each branch will grow from. I'm happy to have a curriculum to guide me through this toolbox of UNIX magic, and to recognize that I have the know-how to research and find what I need within the dev community.
      </p>
      <p>
      OK Recap!--Let's talk version control. What are the benefits?  
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Collaborate on projects with other people and work simulteanously</li>
        <li>Track and merge all major changes to a file from multiple people</li>
        <li>Keep a master version unpolluted by funky code</li>
        <li>Test different versions before declaring it final</li>
      </ul>
     
      <p>
      The way I see it, a world without version control would be a very scary, unproductive and confusing place, with hundreds of local versions of the same files and no safe or efficient way to ever merge changes! 
      </p>
      <p>
      This would be like sending an essay to 3-4 people to critique, and then receiving dozens of mysterious, untracked changes. You'd have to compare 4 different versions and find all the changes yourself! How awful! Fortunately, version control has made it so developers will never need to experience such woes.
      </p>
    <p>
    So how do you implement version control you ask? You use a version control system like Git!
    </p>
    <p>
    Git is a software that lives on your local machine and you can use it within your terminal. It helps you keep track of your changes by creating branched versions off of your master copy. Your master is just as it sounds--the very final version of whatever you're working on. You can work on each branch separately and then merge them all together into the master when they're absolutely ready. There are a few key commands you need to use git:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>git checkout -b [name]<br>
      The [name] placeholder is where you would put your branch name. This command creates a new branch from your master version.</li> 
      <li>git status<br>
      This command shows whether any of the files or directories in your branch have any changes, and in what stage they're in for the version control process. They can either be "untracked", "added", or "staged to commit". When you commit the changes, they disappear from your status log.</li>
      <li>git add<br>
      This adds a file so that it's 'staged to commit' and the changes can be tracked and committed as final.</li>
      <li>git commit<br>
      This step saves your changes and updates your local repository with the new version.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
      So why use GitHub?
    </p>
    <p> 
      GitHub is an online Git repository hosting service where you can push and store your local git versions. This is useful so you can work together with others on the same project, and everything is stored in the cloud, making it more accessible. GitHub also provides a social networking and community-driven environment for reviewing and collaborating on projects.
