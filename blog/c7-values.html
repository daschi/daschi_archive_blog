      <h1>Examining my values</h1>
      <h3>How do I mitigate stereotype threat and feelings of inadequacy?</h3>
      <h4>2015-06-10</h4>
    </div>

    <h2>My Values</h2>
    <p>Last week I touched upon stereotype threat/imposter syndrome, and I shared a personal experience reflecting on past events that led to imposter syndrome. These feelings dissipated through a combination of self-affirmation and confirmation from others. I affirmed myself via the accomplishments and milestones I'd reached, and I was confirmed by others that I belonged and was a part of the community. It looks like there are studies showing that affirming your values helps to combat feelings of stereotype threat, and helps you to strive towards an ideal that you believe you can achieve.</p>
    <p>Considering a time in my life when I've been the happiest, proudest and most satisfied, I'd say the following values come to mind: </p>      
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Having a family</li>
        <li>Accomplishment</li>
        <li>Close relationships</li>
        <li>Cooperation</li>          
        <li>Creativity</li>  
        <li>Helping others</li>  
        <li>Persistence</li>
        <li>Integrity</li>
        <li>Honesty (with myself & others)</li>
      </ul>
     
<p>I try to live up to these values as much as possible, particularly the honesty with myself one. I find myself struggling with accepting my own limitations, being kind to myself, and knowing when I have tried my best. My family is also very important to me, and I since I'm on the other side of the country, I make it a daily effort to keep in touch with them. I think if I lost this connection, I would lose a lot of my sense of stability and self-worth. I really like the value accomplishment, because it will mean something different to everyone. For me, I feel happy when I accomplish anything, even small steps towards a larger goal.</p>
<p>I would say the value I give advice on frequently is integrity. Sometimes there's a very blurry line in situations where you're not sure what to do and how to maintain integrity. I try my best every day to treat others as I expect them to treat me, no matter what. This means even if they treat me poorly, I will maintain my values and stick by my integrity. It's important to always take the high road, especially for our own sense of self-worth, self-love and self-esteem. Lots of Self here.</p>
<p>I feel encouraged when I think about my values. I look at these words and recognize my behaviors within them and how they make me feel like I am doing the best that I can at any given moment, depending on circumstances and environment. If I find myself feeling down at DBC, I'd probably seek out conversation via close relationships, or seek out the counselors provided by DBC. I think talking to others and re-affirming myself is the best way I can mitigate any feelings of stereotype threat or feelings of inadequacy.</p>
