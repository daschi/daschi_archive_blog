      <h1>Pairing &amp; Feedback</h1>
      <h3>Week 5: Cultural Reflection</h3>
      <h4>2015-05-30</h4>
    </div>
    <h2>How does it make you feel?</h2>
    <p>A large reason I decided to pursue DevBootcamp over other programs was the clear focus on providing feedback and collaborating with others. As part of the Phase 0 session, we are asked to pair with another student on the week's challenge, and then provide anonymous feedback on our pairing session. During my first few pairing sessions, I was surprised at how nervous I was to make a positive impression on my pair. I tried my best to be as open as possible with my communication and to always check in with the other person. One of the most recurring feelings I get when I pair is feeling uncertain of how the other person feels. I think a lot of what leads to this feeling is the distance, and using Hangouts to meet. It's harder to read a person's emotional state online than it is in person, and I feel much more comfortable adapting my behavior and approach with someone when I'm in person and can clearly see how I am affecting them. I've been trying to overcome this feeling by trying to ask when appropriate if the other person is okay, but sometimes that's not as easy or natural to do online. </p>
    <p>However, uncomfortable feelings aside, the pairings are incredibly fun to do. I love getting the chance to meet new people and figure out problems together, and I've had very positive experiences with everyone I've paired with so far. There's a great sense of "we're in this together" and it really shines through when you're feeling stuck on a challenge and your pair is able to help, or vice versa.</p>
    <p>Up until now the feedback I've read for myself has been pretty rewarding. It makes me feel good to see that other's have been actively engaged in our session enough to reflect on it later, and to provide me with input that's kind and constructive. I've received a lot of feedback about how to approach the driver/navigator roles, and I've been taking that feedback very seriously! I think it will take a combination of practice and mindful changes of behavior to be confident in either role. For now, I definitely feel more confident as a driver, and I think it's because as a navigator it's sometimes hard for me to direct someone without feeling like I'm taking over completely. At least with the driver role, I feel like I can take input from the navigator, and then add my own thoughts while executing it. I think I can improve on this by navigating more and seeing how others feel about my navigator performance afterward. I may start to ask my pair at the end of the session for some more immediate feedback on this.</p>
    <p>Writing the feedback was very difficult for me. I find it very challenging to verbalize my perception of an interaction with someone, as usually I feel like I try to adapt myself to the other person when needed, so as I'm actively adapting myself, I sometimes forget to take down mental notes of what the other person could improve on or what they did well. I found that my feedback was usually kind, but that I could really improve on the specific and actionable parts. To recap, feedback should be Kind, Actionable and Specific. I try to think of this in terms of: What did my pair do that helped us? How could they do it differently, or should they do it differently? How do I offer advice or options for trying other approaches that may work?</p>
    <p>Overall, I think the pairing is definitely an essential piece of my learning. Especially since it is so widely used in tech companies and it seems to be an established best practice for working with others on a team. I see this as an ongoing challenge to practice and improve on each time I try it. I try to pair on almost every challenge to get as much experience as possible. As for feedback, I think it's helpful to see it, but I also think I would benefit from more immediate and personal feedback from the pair at the end of the session.</p>
