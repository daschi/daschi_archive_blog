      <h1>Conflict</h1>
      <h3>Analyzing a past conflict and my basic emotions</h3>

     <h2>Car Sharing Conflict</h2>
      <p>This week I will practice discussing a past conflict I had and examining my emotions, approach and identifying what I could have done differently. This will be a good exercise for reflecting on future conflicts and trying to understand it from the big picture and the perspective of the situation's affects on the people and situation around me.</p>

      <p>1. Discuss a time you had a conflict. What was it about? What happened?<br>
      I wanted to use a recent example, since I think I've grown a lot in the past few years in how I try to approach conflicts. A recent conflict involved a person who rented my car through a car sharing service. They returned it to me while I was at work, so I didn't get a chance to look at the car later in the day. When I looked, there was damage to the rear bumper and it could only be fixed by being completely replaced. I contacted the car sharing service and they gave me only two options: deal directly with the renter to cover the cost, or go through the service and they would contact the renter. The problem with the second choice was that the renter would have to pay for the entire damage and also additional fees for me having the service take care of it.</p>
      <p>What was the source of the conflict?<br>
      The source of the conflict is hard to pinpoint. The renter didn't realize that the bumper was damaged, which made me think it happened while it was parked on the street, or they were lying. Since I gave them the benefit of the doubt, I assumed it was an accident that could have happened to anyone. However, in the eyes of the car sharing service, since the car was under the renter's responsibility, even no-fault accidents were not covered by the insurance without the renter paying for it.</p>
      <p>What basic emotions did you feel upon analyzing the conflict?<br>
      At first I felt angry at the renter because I initially suspected that they were lying to me. However, after thinking the situation over and over again, I decided it would be best to believe that it really was an accident and that the renter did not realize the accident happened. This made me a lot calmer and it made it easier to talk to the renter and ask them how we could deal with this. Additionally, I felt frustrated with the car sharing service because they did not cover accidents that were no fault of the renter, so I had to choose whether to pay for it myself, ask the renter to pay for it, or have the car sharing service force the renter to pay for it. This was also a moral dilemma for me because it was over a very expensive fix and I didn't want to impose that on someone just because it could have happened to anyone.</p>
      <p>What actions did you take to resolve your conflict?<br>
      <p>I decided to talk to the renter directly and let them know that I understood it was an accident and that it may not have been their fault. I asked them if they could offer any contribution to help get the bumper fixed and I phrased it so that they would have an easy out if they could not contribute anything. I was relieved when they offered to cover half of the cost to fix the bumper. I felt that going to them directly and being honest and open with them led to this compromise.</p>
      <p>If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
      <p>I'm not sure I would do anything differently, because I felt like it was a pretty good example of a compromise. I look back at this example as a time when I approached a situation only after I'd examined my initial emotions, so I wouldn't have to burden the person with negative feelings when they may not even realize they did something to upset me.</p>
      <p>What did you learn from this experience?<br>
      From this and similar experiences I've learned that the best way to resolve a conflict is to talk about it openly, and also to talk about it when you're not feeling upset or angry. It's important to respect another person's emotional space, and approaching someone you are feeling angry will likely make the other person angry as well. Two angry people are never a productive force, and any chance of resolving the conflict is probably lost at that point. It usually works well when both parties are understanding and respectful of the other's intention and feelings.</p>
