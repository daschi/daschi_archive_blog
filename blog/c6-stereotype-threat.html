      <h1>Stereotype Threat, Imposter Syndrome</h1>
      <h3>an introspective look at my identity in a new group setting</h3>
      <h4>2015-06-05</h4>

    <p>When I've heard about imposter syndrome, I always think back to my undergraduate experience. I went to a small school in Virginia that is considered to be one of the more prestigious colleges. I transferred into this school my sophomore year, so I always felt a stigma about not being a student accepted straight from high school. Only in retrospect do I realize that I was affected by imposter syndrome, and that a lot of these feelings I had came from by my own fears and perceptions of the school, and not as much by the behaviors of those around me. It's interesting to think that in the face of being accepted to a great school, and having the opportunity to study my favorite subject among well-established professors, my own mind decided to turn on itself and give me endless anxiety and relentless thoughts about how I'd somehow tricked all these people into believing that I deserved to be there. I always had anxiety about performing well, while always considering myself as "not good enough". It affected my achievement by dictating which classes I thought I could take. Even though I was very good at math in high school, I didn't dare go near the engineering classes because they sounded "too hard for me". Alas, I wish I could go back in time! I would shake my old self and scream YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH, YOU CAN DO THIS.</p>

    <p>It's tough when you are your own worst enemy, but then on top of that you don't have anyone else in your corner cheering you on. Not to say it's anyone else's fault, but I do wonder if it would've been different if I had teachers in high school who recognized my potential and suggested these paths for me. I am a first generation college student in my family, so I navigated that world entirely on my own, and it was all extremely new and overwhelming for me. I made all my decisions myself, and didn't know I could ask for help. I think at the time I was scared to ask for help because I thought it would reveal to others that I didn't know what I was doing. As an 18 year old starting college with no prior information about it, that was a terrifying feeling. Now that I'm older and I've gone through a lot of learning experiences, I'm always willing to admit when I don't know something, because I've learned from my past mistakes that you only get ahead by asking more questions, learning from the answers, and implementing new concepts going forward.</p>

    <p>I remember my anxiety waning when I started to make more friends, and getting to know the other students at the college better. By being accepted into the group, I started to give way to the nagging feeling that I didn't belong there, because the people around me actively affirmed my belonging.</p>

    <p>When I think about it now, I was extremely privileged to have this support system to take me out of the anxiety-filled world I'd created for myself. There's a lot of people who don't have that same experience, and don't lose that imposter feeling. I'm no expert, but I think for me what worked was consistent affirmation of my place in that world. It's so clear to me the moment I went from feeling like I constantly did not belong, to feeling like a worthwhile, intelligent person. Getting to that point took some time, but once I felt it, I ran with it and really found myself succeeding at school in a way I'd never done before. I also credit one of my linguistics professors who at the time required two self reflections a week. These reflections were free-flowing thoughts about what we'd learned, and how this related to me personally. She'd respond to these reflections and I think her responses were crucial to making me feel like I wasn't faking it, that I really did have intellect, and that the only thing stopping me from contributing to the community and to the academic field were my unfounded feelings of inadequacy (as always, thank you Professor Charity Hudley!)</p>

    <p>To summarize, I think they key for me to reduce this sense is support and affirmation. Having someone believe in you more than you even believe in yourself is a very powerful force. I see this quality in amazing teachers, and in friends who care about your future. I strive to do this for others as I hope they would for me.</p>
