      The DBC cultural emphasis is by far the number one reason I chose to apply to this program over other schools. Before I even applied I felt inspired by Shereef's Fireside Chat, and I sought out more and more videos, blogs and DBC communities online, each time being encouraged to apply and feeling an inner confirmation that this would be a worthwhile and life changing path for me.

      I relate completely with the fear of coming in and being surrounded by much more advanced students. However, I know myself and I know I have the motivation and the mindset to approach this opportunity and take from it as much as I possibly can. If I am surrounded by students that are more advanced than me, then GOOD! I'll have more resources and people to learn from! Saying that, the opposite is also true, in either situation, I am entering an environment where we all have similar goals and passion to take this curriculum and opportunity head on. In the end, your own motivation and your ability to interact with others in genuine, hardworking and passionate ways is what will matter the most. 
     </p>

      Once I realized this, my fears subsided and instead came undeniable excitement and determination to succeed, and to succeed in my own definition of success, which includes trying my best at whatever I set my mind to, endlessly feeding my creativity, and building something that I can be proud of, alongside others that I am proud to call my colleagues and companions. 
    </p>

  	 Another point that resonated with me was understanding the time-box concept. I feel that before entering DBC, I spent hours and hours reading about different CS or programming concepts, only to find at the end of the "rabbit hole", my broad overall understanding only minimally benefitted from this method. There's so many resources and information out there for development, and learning how to pipeline all of that in a coherent path is something I struggled with alone. I look forward to working with others to capture a broad understanding, and also to learn techniques on how to sharpen different branches of this understanding in both time and quality efficient ways.
